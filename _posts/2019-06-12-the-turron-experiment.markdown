The turrón experiment is a short project that Eva and I set ourselves to do in our free time, with the only purpose of learning how to properly conduct a scientific experiment, including things like:

* experimental design
    * specifying our question
    * putting it in the form of null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis
    * defining the relevant variables
    * controlling for confounding factors
    * choosing in advance the best statistical test and doing a power analysis
* data collection
* data analysis
    * processing with tools like pandas
    * plotting with matplotlib and seaborn
    * statistical tests with statsmodels and sklearn
* reporting
